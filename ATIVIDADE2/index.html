        <h2>WHAT IT IS</h2>
        <p>Dark Souls, Dark Souls II and Dark Souls III are a series of fantasy action-RPG games developed by From Software and published by Namco Bandai Games. The Dark Souls series is the spiritual successor to From Software's PlayStation 3 exclusive Demon's Souls. Dark Souls II was released in North America for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on March 11, 2014, on March 13,
             2014 in Japan, and on March 14, 2014 in the EU. It was released for PC on April 24th, 2014.</p>

                <h4>Dark Souls</h4>
                <p>There are some things that only videogames can do. For me, Dark Souls' predecessor Demon's Souls was emblematic of all of them. Where most games do their best to be something else – to tell a story like a novel, to impress with cinematic techniques like a film – Demon's Souls is pure game, a complete and darkly fascinating
                 vision that makes no concessions to the modern conception of how games should be. Instead, it was an exploration of how games could be; how bleak, how twisted, how focused and – most famously – how challenging. Most developers take pains to protect you from failure. 
                 FROM Software turns it into an artform.</p>

                <h4>Expectation</h4>
                <p>You will die, a lot. You will die on the end of a sword, on the edge of an axe, crushed by a boulder, impaled on fangs; you will be poisoned, eaten, stabbed, assassinated and pushed off cliffs. Death is everything in Dark Souls. It's education, it's progress, it's the recurring stylistic and thematic motif that runs through 
                    all of its spectacularly varied, decaying and depraved environments. The first thing that you have to understand about this game is that survival is in itself a tremendous accomplishment. It can be punishing, cruel, sadistic and uncompromising. It can also be the purest, most thrilling adrenaline rush in gaming – it can take
                     over your life and reward you like nothing else can. Exactly because your chances of success are so slim, each victory
                      feels monumental.</p>

            <h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>
            <section class = "s3">
                <h4>Dark Souls</h4>
                <p>Dark Souls is a third-person action role-playing game. The core mechanic of the game is exploration. Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternate areas to explore. Dark Souls takes place in a large and continuous open world environment, connected through a central hub area (Firelink Shrine). 
                    Players are able to travel to and from areas and explore various paths at will, although certain prerequisites have to be met in order to unlock certain areas. Central to Dark Souls are Bonfires. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and serve as checkpoints for each level. When rested at, the player is healed to full, healing charges are restored,
                     but all of the enemies (except for bosses, mini-bosses, and specific characters) respawn. While resting, players can level up and perform other 
                     key functions.</p>
